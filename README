Aaron Mahan's dotfiles.

Note: gitconfig_global no longer displays properly in GitHub after I added two
literal carriage return characters to the OS X 'Icon' rule, so that git will
correctly ignore OS X generated 'Icon' files that end in a literal carriage
return character (although they can deceptively appear as 'Icon?', they are
actually 'Icon\r'). You can check out this blog post for more information:
